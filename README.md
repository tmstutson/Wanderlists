Wanderlist is a single-page to-do application that features a fluid user interface that by using JavaScript allows users to rapidly add dynamic content and check off content as accomplished. You can access the Wanderlist application here https://wanderlists-tia-stutson.herokuapp.com ! Try it out! 

Wanderlist refreshes at its user's convenience and clears its fields so that users can start a new list on their own. My vision of a digital notepad that saves the planet!
